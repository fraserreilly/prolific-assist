# prolific-assist
Userscript that adds additional functionality like automatically disabling animations, hiding popups and notifying the user on surveys that meet a minimum pay threshold. 

## Getting Started
### Requirements:
- Tampermonkey

## Running the script
- [Install prolific assist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FraserReilly/prolific-assist/main/assist.user.js)
- Once the script is installed you don't have to do anything. You can increase or decrease the survey pay notification threshold by adjusting minStudyPay variable to the preferred value (for reference federal minimum wage is $7.25).
